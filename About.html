            <p>The D&D club is a place for D&D players of all kinds to gather and play in a safe environment. Whether you're brand new to D&D or have been playing since 3rd grade, the D&D club is a safe haven to grow your skills.</p>

            <p>In addition to just hanging out and playing D&D, The Dungeon Masters of the club will be able to hang out, discuss (and laugh over mishaps in) their respective campaigns, and brainstorm ideas together in a private seciton of <a href="https://discord.gg/5bUAXb4bW9" class="textLink" target="_blank">the club's discord.</a></p>

            <p>Not only is D&D a fun passtime, it also helps you to practice things, like acting and improv. <i>(I personally used it to develop a badass pirate accent. yarr)</i></p>

            <h2>What is D&D?</h2>
            <p>Imagine writing a book. D&D is very similar. The difference lies in that you tell the story not through writing but through words and the cooperation of friends at a table. The Dungeon Master (DM) controls everything in the world, including non player characters (NPCs), environment, enemies, allies, plotline, etc. The only thing that the DM can't control is your character. Your character is free to do anything you wish, and your fellow players are granted the same luxury with their respective characters. Many more experienced D&D players will go 'into characer', acting out their character's actions and speaking to other players or NPCs in the first person, using their characer's accent and spoken mannerisms, rather than simply dictating their character's dialogue and actions. If you're feeling brave, go ahead and try it!<br><br> In order to not have an overpowered mess of <i>'my character is so cool they can do anything'</i> arguments, the rules of D&D are written down on character sheets and rulebooks that document common guidelines to constrian the characters' powers and abilities to aceptable and realistic levels. When interacting with the world, you use a combination of these guidelines and dice to determine the outcome of an action. Your character's personal skills supplement this roll to tilt the random odds of the dice in your favor or disfavor. For example your character might be strong so any action requiring strength has a bonus. However, if your character is also dumb then you would have a penalty to any action requiring intelligence. Your roll may be your own, but the impact that it has on the game is determined by the DM (Dungeon Master), who illustrates how it effects the world.</p>

            <h2 class: "pTitle">The Importance of D&D</h2>
            <!--TYPE DOWN HERE-->
            <p>Why do we play? Why do you people sit around a table for hours on end getting excited at dice rolling? And no, its not because of a gambling addiction. We play D&D because it inspires greater comradery between friends to work as a team and complete a task whils exploring a story first-hand. Going on an adventure as a group, conquering odds, and accomplishing goals in a fantastical universe is why we play D&D. However, at its most basic, it's just a simple excuse for friends to get together and share a moment of respite from their lives.</p>
